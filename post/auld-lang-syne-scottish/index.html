        <p>It was originally sung to a different tune from the current one. This is a level 4 arrangement of the popular scottish folk song “auld lang syne.” part one has the melody, part two has some chordal accompaniment figures . While it was sung in many variations for centuries, the famous scottish poet robert burns first wrote this poem down in 1788 and sent it to the scots musical .</p>

        <p>Auld lang syne (literally old long since) is thought to be the second most commonly sung song in the whole world regardless of country, race or religion, . Born in alloway, scotland, on january 25, 1759, robert burns was the author of poems, chiefly in the scottish dialect (1786) and tam o&#039; shanter (1795). The poem&#039;s scots title may be translated into standard english as old long since or, less literally, long long ago, days gone by, or old times.</p>
